# CheesySloth.github.io

Hi, I'm Cheesy aka Cameron. I am currently uploading past programming projects to my github and developing a portfolio website. I am a full time student so this will probably take some time.
I am available for work and internships during the summer (May to September). My courses and projects have included and given me a basic understanding of:

- Java
- Python
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Basic Algorithms

Feel free to contact via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheesysloth/) for more information.

> Stay Cheesy :)
