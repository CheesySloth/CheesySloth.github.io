Hi, I'm Cheesy aka Cameron. I am currently uploading past programming projects to my github and developing a portfolio website. I am a full time student so this will probably take some time. I will be working as a Software Engineer Intern at American Express this summer. Although I intend to apply for the grad program with AMEX after university, I am open to other grad programs or part-time programming work during the semester. My courses and projects have included and given me a basic understanding of:

- Java
- Python
- CSS
- HTML
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Basic Algorithms

Feel free to contact via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cheesysloth/) or via [email](mailto:cameronfuller@hotmail.co.uk) for more information.

> Stay Cheesy :)
